This is a <b>React + Web3.0</b> project where we can send <b>crypto currencies</b> to any specific address.<br />
Along with this, we can send some <b>GIF</b> to make the <b>transaction</b> more interesting.<br />
This project is currently under heavy development phase.<br />

Currently I'm testing the smart contracts over Goerli Ethereum <b>[https://goerlifaucet.com/]</b> test net ! <br />
