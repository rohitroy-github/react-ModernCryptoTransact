This is a <b>React + Web3.0</b> project where we can send <b>crypto currencies</b> to any specific address.<br />

Along with this, we can send some <b>GIF</b> to make the <b>transaction</b> more interesting.<br />

This project is currently under heavy development phase.<br />

Currently I'm testing the smart contracts over <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/"><b>Goerli</a> Ethereum</b> test net ! <br />
